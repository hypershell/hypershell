Description
-----------

HyperShell is an elegant, cross-platform, high-throughput computing utility for processing
shell commands over a distributed, asynchronous queue. It is a highly scalable workflow automation
tool for many-task scenarios.

Typically, ad hoc usage or batch jobs will use the ``cluster`` workflow. This automatically stands
up the ``server`` and one or more ``client`` instances on remote servers and processes the commands
from some input *FILE* until completion.

Operate with an in-memory queue, or configure a database to manage task scheduling and persistence.
Stand up the ``server`` on its own and scale ``clients`` as desired, and ``submit`` tasks independently.

Environment Variables
---------------------

As stated for configuration, any environment variable prefixed as ``HYPERSHELL_``
where the name aligns to the path to some option, delimited by underscores,
will set that option. Example, ``HYPERSHELL_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`` maps to the
corresponding configuration option.

The following environment variables must be specified as such and cannot be configurable
within files.

.. include:: _include/config_site_vars.rst

.. include:: _include/config_pythonpath.rst

.. include:: _include/config_task_env_alt.rst

We also respect setting the following environment variables to force disable/enable
the use of colors in all console output.

``NO_COLOR``
    If this variable is set to anything but a blank string, all colors are disabled.
    See `no-color.org <https://no-color.org>`_ for details.

``FORCE_COLOR``
    If this variable is set to anything but a blank string, colors will be enabled
    regardless of whether `stdout` or `stderr` are a TTY.

Signals
-------

HyperShell traps the following UNIX signals (does not apply on Microsoft Windows).
