Automatic database rotation for SQLite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using `SQLite` as a backend for long persistent deployments the overall throughput
can suffer due to the increased size of the database. What we would like is to keep our long task
history while alleviating the burden of such a large database on task throughput. To accomplish
this we've added two new admin routines, ``vacuumdb()`` and ``rotatedb()``, and exposed them via
the command-line interface via ``hs initdb`` as ``--vacuum``, ``--backup``, and ``--rotate``.

For those unfamiliar with the concept, `VACUUM` is a database operation (PostgreSQL and SQLite)
that optimizes space and can improve performance in some cases. For SQLite, updated rows are
written to new pages, even deleting data is only flagged as such. Performing a vacuum copies
all active pages to a new database file and then replaces the original database file. This
operation is safe to perform while under load. This on its own is a useful feature to have for
long running deployments.

For SQLite, the vacuum operation allows for a file path and instead of copying the new cleaned
pages back to the original file the data is left at the given file path. This capability is what
drives the ``--backup`` feature, and in turn enables the ``--rotate`` feature.

With this release we now automatically add a ``part:0`` tag to all new tasks. This ``part``, short
for *partition*, is used to label all completed tasks in the activate database with ``part:N`` in
a single transaction, where *N* is the N-th partition chosen based on the path to the file. With
this tag as a means to safely distinguish between the completed tasks in that moment, we can
partition the activate database using a vacuum operation to a new location, essentially cloning
the database. Afterwards, we drop any non-``part:N`` tasks from the new clone and any ``part:N``
from the activate database. This can happen in real time without stopping the server.

Immediately following one of these partition events, there will be few tasks in the activate database.
While searching task history we want to allow for the full history without losing access because we
split the database. Now, when invoking task search, if SQLite is in use, we automatically check for
any/all existing partitions of the same database path and `attach` each to the session. We build a
temporary `view` that replaces the ``task`` table with a series of ``union all`` on these partitions.
Any and all queries are applied to this temporary view as if the entire history existed within the
one table.

.. note::

    With most distributions of Python the `sqlite3` library is built with a compile-time option
    ``SQLITE_MAX_ATTACHED=10`` by default. While ``--rotate`` can be called any number of times,
    the automatic attachment of these partitions will be limited by this settings. While it's
    possible to re-compile SQLite with a higher value, it cannot be increased above 125.

Optional UUIDv7 Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new package extra, ``hypershell[uuid7]``, installs a third-party dependency,
`uuid-utils <https://pypi.org/project/uuid-utils/>`_, which provides for
lexicographically-sortable version 7 UUIDs. The format specification for UUID
version 7 has essentially solidified and library support for use of this format is well supported
and widely used.

See `RFC 9562 (draft standard) <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html#name-uuid-version-7>`_
for reference.

In large-scale performance testing with HyperShell it is difficult to say precisely what the
net benefit of UUIDv7 has been on overall task throughput. The increase in performance comes from
less cache-misses in page loads due to the time ordering of task rows. It is likely the case that
task bundles will consist of tasks submitted close in time to one another. Updating these tasks is
more efficient when they reside within the same collection of pages, instead of being randomly
distributed within the b-tree.

Generation of UUIDs within the project has been refactored to an internal routine.
This routine calls ``uuid.uuid4`` from the standard library and returns a string.
If ``uuid-utils`` is available in the installation we prefer ``uuid_utils.uuid7``.
This functionality install-time behavior and is not configurable at runtime.

.. note::

    On SQLite there is no real benefit to UUID v7.
    SQLite employs a hidden ``rowid`` column when using a non-integer primary key.
    The pages in the database are actually stored according to this hidden ``rowid``.
    The overhead of the second lookup is minimal compared to the huge performance improvement
    due to the page ordering.

    In testing, adding the ``WITHOUT ROWID`` table modifier results in a significant reduction
    in performance, and adding UUIDv7 on top of that entirely recovers this performance.
    Incorporating both the table modifier and UUIDv7 is relatively insignificant.

SQLite Pragmas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It has always been technically possible to enable WAL-mode for SQLite by connecting outside
of HyperShell and applying the setting. But this is inelegant and doesn't help with settings
that do not persist between connections. Now you can include a ``pragmas`` section in your
configuration to automatically apply these to all database connections.

The most useful change from the default behavior is to enable the Write-Ahead Log (WAL)
``journal_mode`` for SQLite which can improve performance in high-concurrency applications.

.. admonition:: Set user-level configuration option
    :class: note

    .. code-block:: shell

        hs config set database.pragmas.journal_mode wal

There are many other pragmas we might set.
Not all configurations of SQLite have been tested for performance.

.. admonition:: Configuration with SQLite pragmas
    :class: note

    .. code-block:: toml

        [database]
        file = "/var/lib/hypershell/main.db"
        pragmas = {journal_mode = "wal", cache_size = 100000}

SQLite Optimization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On a related note, all ``vacuumdb()`` operations (used by ``--vacuum`` and ``--rotate``) add
an automatic ``pragma optimize`` operation. This is mostly harmless and can be invoked safely
on a regular basis.

See `optimize <https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_optimize>`_ for details.
